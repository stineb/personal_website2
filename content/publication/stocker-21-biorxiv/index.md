abstract: The rooting zone water storage capacity (S0) extends from the soil surface
  to the weathered bedrock (the Critical Zone) and determines land-atmosphere exchange
  during dry periods. Despite its importance to land-surface modeling, variations
  of S0 across space are largely unknown as they cannot be observed directly. We developed
  a method to diagnose global variations of S0 from the relationship between vegetation
  activity (measured by sun-induced fluorescence and by the evaporative fraction)
  and the cumulative water deficit (CWD). We then show that spatial variations in
  S0 can be predicted from the assumption that plants are adapted to sustain CWD extremes
  occurring with a return period that is related to the life form of dominant plants
  and the large-scale topographical setting. Predicted biome-level S0 distributions,
  translated to an apparent rooting depth (zr) by accounting for soil texture, are
  consistent with observations from a comprehensive zr dataset. Large spatial variations
  in S0 across the globe reflect adaptation of zr to the hydroclimate and topography
  and implies large heterogeneity in the sensitivity of vegetation activity to drought.
  The magnitude of S0 inferred for most of the Earthtextquoterights vegetated regions
  and particularly for those with a large seasonality in their hydroclimate indicates
  an important role for plant access to water stored at depth - beyond the soil layers
  commonly considered in land-surface models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
