abstract: A Dynamic Global Vegetation model coupled to a simplified Earth system model
  is used to simulate the impact of anthropogenic land cover changes (ALCC) on Holocene
  atmospheric CO(2) and the contemporary carbon cycle. The model results suggest that
  early agricultural activities cannot explain the mid to late Holocene CO(2) rise
  of 20 ppm measured on ice cores and that proposed upward revisions of Holocene ALCC
  imply a smaller contemporary terrestrial carbon sink. A set of illustrative scenarios
  is applied to test the robustness of these conclusions and to address the large
  discrepancies between published ALCC reconstructions. Simulated changes in atmospheric
  CO(2) due to ALCC are less than 1 ppm before 1000AD and 30 ppm at 2004AD when the
  HYDE3.1 ALCC reconstruction is prescribed for the past 12 000 years. Cumulative
  emissions of 69 GtC at 1850 and 233 GtC at 2004AD are comparable to earlier estimates.
  CO(2) changes due to ALCC exceed the simulated natural interannual variability only
  after 1000 AD. To consider evidence that land area used per person was higher before
  than during early industrialisation, agricultural areas from HYDE3.1 were increased
  by a factor of two prior to 1700AD (scenario H2). For the H2 scenario, the contemporary
  terrestrial carbon sink required to close the atmospheric CO(2) budget is reduced
  by 0.5 GtC yr(-1). Simulated CO(2) remains small even in scenarios where average
  land use per person is increased beyond the range of published estimates. Even extreme
  assumptions for preindustrial land conversion and high per- capita land use do not
  result in simulated CO(2) emissions that are sufficient to explain the magnitude
  and the timing of the late Holocene CO(2) increase.
