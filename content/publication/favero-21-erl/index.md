abstract: This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and
  economic impacts of climate change on global and regional forests from now through
  2200. By integrating the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP
  8.5 emission scenarios with climate models, a vegetation model, socio-economic scenarios,
  and a forest economic model, the study explores long run adjustments of both ecosystems
  and markets to climate change that have not been studied before. The ecological
  model suggests that global forest productivity increases under RCP 8.5. The overall
  supply of timber expands faster than demand through the 23rd century lowering timber
  prices and creating net benefits in the timber sector. Consumers benefit the most
  from the lower prices but these same low prices tend to damage forest owners, especially
  in the tropics. Even without a formal sequestration policy, average global forest
  carbon is projected to increase by 6%â€“8% by 2100. Under the RCP 2.6, forest carbon
  remains stable through 2200 but under RCP 8.5 it is simulated to increase by another
  8% with a very heterogeneous distribution across world regions. Under both RCPs,
  global forest area is projected to increase relative to a no-climate change case
  until 2150, but possibly decline thereafter.
