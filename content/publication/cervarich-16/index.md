abstract: Accomplishing the objective of the current climate policies will require
  establishing carbon budget and flux estimates in each region and county of the globe
  by comparing and reconciling multiple estimates including the observations and the
  results of top-down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) inversions and bottom-up
  dynamic global vegetation models. With this in view, this study synthesizes the
  carbon source/sink due to net ecosystem productivity (NEP), land cover land use
  change ( E LUC ), fires and fossil burning ( E FIRE ) for the South Asia (SA), Southeast
  Asia (SEA) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA = SA + SEA) and each country in these
  regions using the multiple top-down and bottom-up modeling results. The terrestrial
  net biome productivity (NBP =NEP -- E LUC -- E FIRE ) calculated based on bottom-up
  models in combination with E FIRE based on GFED4s data show net carbon sinks of
  217 $±$ 147, 10 $±$ 55, and 227 $±$ 279 TgC yr −1 for SA, SEA, and SSEA. The top-down
  models estimated NBP net carbon sinks were 20 $±$ 170, 4 $±$ 90 and 24 $±$ 180 TgC
  yr −1 . In comparison, regional emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels were
  495, 275, and 770 TgC yr −1 , which are many times higher than the NBP sink estimates,
  suggesting that the contribution of the fossil fuel emissions to the carbon budget
  of SSEA results in a significant net carbon source during the 2000s. When considering
  both NBP and fossil fuel emissions for the individual countries within the regions,
  Bhutan and Laos were net carbon sinks and rest of the countries were net carbon
  source during the 2000s. The relative contributions of each of the fluxes (NBP,
  NEP, E LUC , and E FIRE , fossil fuel emissions) to a nation's net carbon flux varied
  greatly from country to country, suggesting a heterogeneous dominant carbon fluxes
  on the country-level throughout SSEA.
