abstract: Abstract Southeast Asia is a region known for active land-use changes (LUC)
  over the past 60 years; yet, how trends in net CO2 uptake and release resulting
  from LUC activities (net LUC flux) have changed through past decades remains uncertain.
  The level of uncertainty in net LUC flux from process-based models is so high that
  it cannot be concluded that newer estimates are necessarily more reliable than older
  ones. Here, we examined net LUC flux estimates of Southeast Asia for the 1980s−2010s
  from older and newer sets of Dynamic Global Vegetation Model simulations (TRENDY
  v2 and v7, respectively), and forcing data used for running those simulations, along
  with two book-keeping estimates (H&N and BLUE). These estimates yielded two contrasting
  historical LUC transitions, such that TRENDY v2 and H&N showed a transition from
  increased emissions from the 1980s to 1990s to declining emissions in the 2000s,
  while TRENDY v7 and BLUE showed the opposite transition. We found that these contrasting
  transitions originated in the update of LUC forcing data, which reduced the loss
  of forest area during the 1990s. Further evaluation of remote sensing studies, atmospheric
  inversions, and the history of forestry and environmental policies in Southeast
  Asia supported the occurrence of peak emissions in the 1990s and declining thereafter.
  However, whether LUC emissions continue to decline in Southeast Asia remains uncertain
  as key processes in recent years, such as conversion of peat forest to oil-palm
  plantation, are yet to be represented in the forcing data, suggesting a need for
  further revision.
