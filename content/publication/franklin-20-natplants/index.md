abstract: 'Plants and vegetation play a critical---but largely unpredictable---role
  in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at
  widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches
  to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics
  by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour:
  natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly
  being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet
  to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles
  to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental
  drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization
  of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key
  traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can
  identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying
  environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could
  be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations
  and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental
  change.'
