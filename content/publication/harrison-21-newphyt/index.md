abstract: Summary Global vegetation and land-surface models embody interdisciplinary
  scientific understanding of the behaviour of plants and ecosystems, and are indispensable
  to project the impacts of environmental change on vegetation and the interactions
  between vegetation and climate. However, systematic errors and persistently large
  differences among carbon and water cycle projections by different models highlight
  the limitations of current process formulations. In this review, focusing on core
  plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying
  hypotheses derived from eco-evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide
  novel, parameter-sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present
  case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of
  core, leaf-level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence.
  EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal
  behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models. EEO approaches to other
  important traits, including the leaf economics spectrum and applications of EEO
  at the community level are active research areas. Independently tested modules emerging
  from EEO studies could profitably be integrated into modelling frameworks that account
  for the multiple time scales on which plants and plant communities adjust to environmental
  change.
