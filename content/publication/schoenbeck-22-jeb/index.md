abstract: Future climate will be characterized by an increase in frequency and duration
  of drought and warming that exacerbates atmospheric evaporative demand. How trees
  acclimate to long-term soil moisture changes and whether these long-term changes
  alter trees’ sensitivity to short-term (day to months) variations of vapor pressure
  deficit (VPD) and soil moisture is largely unknown. Leaf gas exchange measurements
  were performed within a long-term (17 years) irrigation experiment in a drought-prone
  Scots pine-dominated forest in one of Switzerland’s driest areas on trees in naturally
  dry (control), irrigated, and ‘irrigation-stop’ (after 11 years of irrigation) conditions.
  Seventeen years of irrigation increased photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance
  (gs) and reduced gs sensitivity to increasing VPD and soil drying. Following irrigation-stop,
  gas exchange decreased only after 3 years. After 5 years, maximum carboxylation
  (Vcmax) and electron transport (Jmax) rates in irrigation-stop recovered to similar
  levels as to before the irrigation-stop. These results suggest that long-term release
  from soil drought reduces the sensitivity to VPD and that atmospheric constraints
  may play an increasingly important role in combination with soil drought. Moreover,
  our study indicates that structural adjustments lead to an attenuation of initially
  strong leaf-level acclimation to strong multiple-year drought.
