abstract: 'Carbon emissions from anthropogenic land use (LU) and land use change (LUC)
  are quantified with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model for the past and the 21st
  century following Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Wood harvesting
  and parallel abandonment and expansion of agricultural land in areas of shifting
  cultivation are explicitly simulated (gross LUC) based on the Land Use Harmonization
  (LUH) dataset and a proposed alternative method that relies on minimum input data
  and generically accounts for gross LUC. Cumulative global LUC emissions are 72 GtC
  by 1850 and 243 GtC by 2004 and 27--151 GtC for the next 95 yr following the different
  RCP scenarios. The alternative method reproduces results based on LUH data with
  full transition information within <0.1 GtC/yr over the last decades and bears potential
  for applications in combination with other LU scenarios. In the last decade, shifting
  cultivation and wood harvest within remaining forests including slash each contributed
  19% to the mean annual emissions of 1.2 GtC/yr. These factors, in combination with
  amplification effects under elevated CO2, contribute substantially to future emissions
  from LUC in all RCPs.Keywords: land use change, carbon cycle, carbon budget, wood
