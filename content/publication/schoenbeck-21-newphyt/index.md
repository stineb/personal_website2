abstract: The future climate will be characterized by an increase in frequency and
  duration of drought and warming that exacerbates atmospheric evaporative demand.
  How trees acclimate to long-term soil moisture changes and whether these long-term
  changes alter treestextquoteright sensitivity to short-term (day to months) variations
  of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture is largely unknown.Leaf gas exchange
  measurements were performed within a long-term (17 years) irrigation experiment
  in a Scots pine-dominated forest in one of Switzerlandtextquoterights driest areas
  on trees in naturally dry (control), irrigated, andtextquoteleftirrigation-stoptextquoteright
  (after 11 years of irrigation) conditions.Seventeen years of irrigation increased
  photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) and reduced the gs sensitivity
  to increasing VPD but not to soil drying. Following irrigation-stop, gas exchange
  did not decrease immediately, but after three years, had decreased significantly
  in irrigation-stop trees. Vcmax and Jmax recovered after five years.These results
  suggest that long-term release of soil drought reduces the sensitivity to atmospheric
  evaporative demand and that atmospheric constraints may play an increasingly important
  role in combination with soil drought. In addition, they suggest that structural
  adjustments lead to an attenuation of initially strong leaf-level acclimation to
  strong multiple-year drought.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
  no competing interest.
