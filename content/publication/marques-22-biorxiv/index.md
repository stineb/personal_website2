abstract: Leaf phenology is key for regulating total growing season mass and energy
  fluxes. Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across
  Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby
  end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates
  and negatively with growing season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations
  have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature
  carbon (C) sink saturation - with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology
  projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multi-decadal ground
  and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and
  EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend
  towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet - in
  spite of the negative Anet-EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This indicates
  that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf
  longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading
  to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation
  CO2 uptake season over time.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
  no competing interest.
