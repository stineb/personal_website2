abstract: AbstractCentury-long observed gridded land precipitation datasets are a
  cornerstone of hydrometeorological research. But recent work has suggested that
  observed Northern Hemisphere midlatitude (NHML) land mean precipitation does not
  show evidence of an expected negative response to mid-twentieth-century aerosol
  forcing. Utilizing observed river discharges, the observed runoff is calculated
  and compared with observed land precipitation. The results show a near-zero twentieth-century
  trend in observed NHML land mean runoff, in contrast to the significant positive
  trend in observed NHML land mean precipitation. However, precipitation and runoff
  share common interannual and decadal variability. An obvious split, or breakpoint,
  is found in the NHML land mean runoff?precipitation relationship in the 1930s. Using
  runoff simulated by six land surface models (LSMs), which are driven by the observed
  precipitation dataset, such breakpoints are absent. These findings support previous
  hypotheses that inhomogeneities exist in the early-twentieth-century NHML land mean
  precipitation record. Adjusting the observed precipitation record according to the
  observed runoff record largely accounts for the departure of the observed precipitation
  response from that predicted given the real-world aerosol forcing estimate, more
  than halving the discrepancy from about 6 to around 2 W m?2. Consideration of complementary
  observed runoff adds support to the suggestion that NHML-wide early-twentieth-century
  precipitation observations are unsuitable for climate change studies. The agreement
  between precipitation and runoff over Europe, however, is excellent, supporting
  the use of whole-twentieth-century observed precipitation datasets here.
