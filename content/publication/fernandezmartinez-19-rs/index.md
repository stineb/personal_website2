abstract: Remotely sensed vegetation indices (RSVIs) can be used to efficiently estimate
  terrestrial primary productivity across space and time. Terrestrial productivity,
  however, has many facets (e.g., spatial and temporal variability, including seasonality,
  interannual variability, and trends), and different vegetation indices may not be
  equally good at predicting them. Their accuracy in monitoring productivity has been
  mostly tested in single-ecosystem studies, but their performance in different ecosystems
  distributed over large areas still needs to be fully explored. To fill this gap,
  we identified the facets of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) that could
  be monitored using RSVIs. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of four
  vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, and CCI), derived from the MODIS MAIAC data
  set and of GPP derived from data from 58 eddy-flux towers in eight ecosystems with
  different plant functional types (evergreen needle-leaved forest, evergreen broad-leaved
  forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, open shrubland, grassland,
  cropland, and wetland) distributed throughout Europe, covering Mediterranean, temperate,
  and boreal regions. The RSVIs monitored temporal variability well in most of the
  ecosystem types, with grasslands and evergreen broad-leaved forests most strongly
  and weakly correlated with weekly and monthly RSVI data, respectively. The performance
  of the RSVIs monitoring temporal variability decreased sharply, however, when the
  seasonal component of the time series was removed, suggesting that the seasonal
  cycles of both the GPP and RSVI time series were the dominant drivers of their relationships.
  Removing winter values from the analyses did not affect the results. NDVI and CCI
  identified the spatial variability of average annual GPP, and all RSVIs identified
  GPP seasonality well. The RSVI estimates, however, could not estimate the interannual
  variability of GPP across sites or monitor the trends of GPP. Overall, our results
  indicate that RSVIs are suitable to track different facets of GPP variability at
  the local scale, therefore they are reliable sources of GPP monitoring at larger
  geographical scales.
