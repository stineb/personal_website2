abstract: Abstract A wide range of research shows that nutrient availability strongly
  influences terrestrial carbon (C) cycling and shapes ecosystem responses to environmental
  changes and hence terrestrial feedbacks to climate. Nonetheless, our understanding
  of nutrient controls remains far from complete and poorly quantified, at least partly
  due to a lack of informative, comparable, and accessible datasets at regional-to-global
  scales. A growing research infrastructure of multi-site networks are providing valuable
  data on C fluxes and stocks and are monitoring their responses to global environmental
  change and measuring responses to experimental treatments. These networks thus provide
  an opportunity for improving our understanding of C-nutrient cycle interactions
  and our ability to model them. However, coherent information on how nutrient cycling
  interacts with observed C cycle patterns is still generally lacking. Here, we argue
  that complementing available C-cycle measurements from monitoring and experimental
  sites with data characterizing nutrient availability will greatly enhance their
  power and will improve our capacity to forecast future trajectories of terrestrial
  C cycling and climate. Therefore, we propose a set of complementary measurements
  that are relatively easy to conduct routinely at any site or experiment and that,
  in combination with C cycle observations, can provide a robust characterization
  of the effects of nutrient availability across sites. In addition, we discuss the
  power of different observable variables for informing the formulation of models
  and constraining their predictions. Most widely available measurements of nutrient
  availability often do not align well with current modelling needs. This highlights
  the importance to foster the interaction between the empirical and modelling communities
  for setting future research priorities.
