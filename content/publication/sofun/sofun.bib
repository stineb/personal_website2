 abstract = {SOFUN is a modelling framework that combines modules for simulating light use efficiency, leaf N, growth and allocation, litter and soil decomposition, N mineralisation and inorganic soil N dynamics. SOFUN is designed in a modular fashion that allows for alternative process representations and levels of integration to be implemented within the same modelling framework.},
