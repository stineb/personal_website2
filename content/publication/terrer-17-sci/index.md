abstract: Norby et al. center their critique on the design of the data set and the
  response variable used. We address these criticisms and reinforce the conclusion
  that plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi exhibit larger biomass and
  growth responses to elevated CO2 compared with plants that associate with arbuscular
  mycorrhizae.
