abstract: The global carbon and water cycles are strongly governed by the simultaneous
  diffusion of CO2 and water vapour through the leaves of terrestrial plants. These
  diffusive fluxes are controlled by plantstextquoteright adaptations to balance carbon
  gains and hydraulic risks. We introduce a trait-based optimality theory that unifies
  the treatment of stomatal responses and biochemical acclimation of plants to changing
  environments. Tested with experimental data from eighteen species, our model successfully
  predicts the simultaneous decline in carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance,
  and photosynthetic capacity during progressive soil drought. It also correctly predicts
  the dependencies of gas exchange on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, temperature,
  and CO2. Consistent with widely observed patterns, inferred trait values for the
  analysed species display a spectrum of stomatal strategies, a safety-efficiency
  trade-off, and a convergence towards low hydraulic safety margins. Our unifying
  theory opens new avenues for reliably modelling the interactive effects of drying
  soil and air and rising atmospheric CO2 on global photosynthesis and transpiration.Competing
