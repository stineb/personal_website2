abstract: The advent of abundant Earth observation data enables the development of
  novel predictive methods for forecasting climate impacts on the state and health
  of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we target the spatial and temporal variations of
  land surface reflectance and vegetation greenness, measuring the density of green
  vegetation and active foliage area, conditioned on current and past climate and
  the local topography. We train two alternative recurrent deep learning models that
  rely on convolutional layers for forecasting the spatially resolved deviation of
  surface reflectance across a heterogeneous landscape from a specified initial state
  (Baseline Framework). We demonstrate efficiency of the Baseline Framework with respect
  to training convergence speed. Using data from diverse ecosystems and land cover
  types across Europe and following a standardized model evaluation framework (EarthNet2021
  Challenge), results indicate increased performance in predicting surface greenness
  during drought events of the models presented here, compared to currently published
  benchmarks. Our results demonstrate how deep learning methods enable early-warning
  of vegetation responses to the impacts of climatic extreme events, such as the drought-related
  loss of green foliage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing
  interest.
