I am a climate and environmental scientist with a special interest in interactions between global environmental change and terrestrial ecology and biogeochemistry. 

My work aims at providing data-informed predictions of how land ecosystems respond to a changing climate, increasing CO2 and changes in nutrient cycles. I am developing process-based models, using eco-evolutionary optimality principles to explain plant trait variations, and I am working on assimilating diverse ecological datasets (eddy covariance, forest inventories, remote sensing, ecosystem manipulation experimental data) into model predictions. In brief, I'm building models, as simple as possible and as complex as necessary to learn the most. All [open access](https://github.com/stineb), of course.

I’m motivated to contribute to a better understanding of issues that are becoming increasingly pressing to society and policy and that are key to creating a sustainable future.
