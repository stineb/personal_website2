I am committed to an Open Science Practice. With [my group](https://computationales.ethz.ch/), we're building an environment of open source tools for ecosystem data and modelling. This should empower the community to use latest methodological developments.

## [rsofun](https://stineb.github.io/rsofun/)

A modelling framework for efficient site-scale simulations of ecosystem processes, implemented as an R package. Implements the following models:

- *P-model* for leaf-level acclimation of photosynthesis, [Stocker et al., 2019 *GMD*](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/1545/2020/))
- *SPLASH* for bioclimatic variables, including the surface radiation budget and the soil water balance, [Davis et al., 2017 *GMD*](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/689/2017/gmd-10-689-2017.html)
- *LM3-PPA* for comprehensive simulations of ecosystem carbon and water cycling, tree growth, and tree cohort-explicit forest dynamics following the Perfect Plasticity Approximation, [Weng et al., 2015](www.biogeosciences.net/12/2655/2015/doi:10.5194/bg-12-2655-2015)
